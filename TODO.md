# TODO

## Logging
Implement a suitable logger that can replace printf.

Also clean up the code base to handle errors more elegantly. Currently 
the application will fail silently withot an explanation or seg fault.

## Assess Metal
Do we need Metal for rendering? This could be useful, Windows will most likely make use
of OpenGL for rendering.
